# Collatz Conjecture: Recent Research and Resources

The **Collatz conjecture** (also known as the *3x+1 problem* or *hailstone problem*) is a famous unsolved problem in mathematics. It asks whether repeatedly applying a simple rule – *halve if even, triple and add 1 if odd* – will eventually bring **any** starting positive integer down to 1 ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=at%20the%20very%20least%20%E2%80%94,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Collatz%20conjecture,no%20general%20proof%20has%20been))  Despite its simple definition, the conjecture has defied proof for decades. It has been verified by computer for all numbers up to about 2.95×10^20 (approximately 2^68) ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=previous%20term%20as%20follows%3A%20if,general%20proof%20has%20been%20found))  ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20all%20initial,58))  but a general proof or counterexample remains elusive. Below is a detailed report on recent findings, notable papers, online resources, and key researchers related to the Collatz conjecture.

## 1. Recent Findings and Developments

**Partial Progress:** In 2019, mathematician **Terence Tao** made a breakthrough partial result on Collatz. Tao proved that the conjecture is *“almost” true for “almost” all numbers* ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=On%20September%208%2C%20Terence%20Tao,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  In particular, he showed that for *most* starting integers (in a density sense), the Collatz sequence eventually attains values much smaller than the initial number ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=for%20all%20sufficiently%20large%20,paper%20we%20obtain%20the%20following))  ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=,the%20sense%20of%20logarithmic%20density))  Formally, Tao’s result (published in 2022) established that for **almost all** $N$, the minimum value attained in the Collatz trajectory is below any growing function $f(N)$ for sufficiently large $N$ ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=,the%20sense%20of%20logarithmic%20density))  This means that *almost every* starting number will sooner or later dip far below its initial size – a strong indication that divergent trajectories are exceedingly unlikely ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=On%20September%208%2C%20Terence%20Tao,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  While not a full proof that **all** numbers reach 1, Tao’s work is considered the most significant Collatz development in decades ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%20one%20of,the%20Collatz%20conjecture%20in%20decades)) 

**Automated Reasoning Approach:** Another recent line of research comes from computer science. In 2023, a team from Carnegie Mellon University and UT Austin – **Emre Yolcu, Scott Aaronson, and Marijn Heule** – explored Collatz through the lens of **automated theorem proving** ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=,feasibility%20of%20our%20approach%20in))  They constructed a **string rewriting system** that simulates Collatz iterations and showed that proving this system always terminates is equivalent to proving the Collatz conjecture itself ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=,feasibility%20of%20our%20approach%20in))  Using automated reasoning tools, they managed to prove some **weakened versions** of Collatz (certain restricted cases or statistical properties) but not the full conjecture ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=prove%20that%20the%20termination%20of,we%20believe%20that%20the%20ideas))  Their work, however, demonstrates *“an interesting new approach”* to this hard problem, bridging techniques from logic and computer science with number theory ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=simulates%20the%20Collatz%20function%20using,represent%20an%20interesting%20new%20approach))  It suggests that novel computational methods might yield further insights or at least verify Collatz behavior under constrained settings.

**Computational Verifications:** On the experimental side, researchers have continued to **push the boundaries of verification**. As of 2020, exhaustive computer searches have confirmed that *all starting integers up to $2^{68} \approx 2.95\times10^{20}$ eventually reach 1* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=previous%20term%20as%20follows%3A%20if,general%20proof%20has%20been%20found))  ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20all%20initial,58))  This enormous computational check (extended from earlier verifications in the 20th century) increases confidence in the conjecture. No counterexample has been found below that bound. Additionally, enthusiasts track **“delay records”** – numbers that take exceptionally long to reach 1 (longest total stopping times) relative to smaller numbers ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=11.%20%5E%20Roosendaal%2C%20Eric.%20,77%20%283%29%3A%202681%E2%80%932688))  These record-holders grow as search limits expand, but so far every tested number, even those with huge stopping times, eventually falls into the loop 4 → 2 → 1. While these computations do not prove the conjecture for all numbers (infinitely many cases remain), they provide valuable data and intuition. They also inspire heuristic arguments (e.g. probabilistic models) suggesting that Collatz orbits tend to descend to 1 on average ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=This%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20work%20for%20the,things%20happen%20all%20the%20time)) 

**Understanding Complexity:** The difficulty of the Collatz problem is well recognized. Results by **John Conway** showed in 1972 that a generalized form of the Collatz iteration can encode an arbitrary computation and is *algorithmically undecidable* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Undecidable%20generalizations))  In other words, solving certain generalized Collatz-type problems is as hard as the **halting problem** in computer science. This does not directly prove anything about the original 3x+1 conjecture, but it indicates why traditional approaches might fail – the problem hides computational complexity. Leading mathematicians have cautioned that Collatz may be “out of reach of present day mathematics” ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Paul%20Erd%C5%91s%20%20said%20about,9))  Indeed, as Jeffrey Lagarias noted, many who become obsessed with it risk getting lost in a **“quagmire”** ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=Mathematicians%20regard%20the%20Collatz%20conjecture,progress%20than%20anyone%20in%20decades))  ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=Experienced%20mathematicians%20warn%20up,never%20do%20meaningful%20work%20again))  Despite this, the recent progress by Tao and others has introduced fresh techniques (from **ergodic theory** and **additive combinatorics** in Tao’s case ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BCol%7D,one%E2%80%99s%20data%20from%20an%20invariant))  and from **logic/CS** in the automated approach) that have inched the field forward.

## 2. Notable Academic Papers

Several academic papers and publications have significantly advanced understanding of the Collatz conjecture or provided important partial results. Below is a list of some notable works, with publication details and links:

- **Terence Tao (2019/2022)** – *“Almost all orbits of the Collatz map attain almost bounded values.”* **Forum of Mathematics, Pi**, **10** (e12), 2022.  Tao’s paper proves that for a set of integers of logarithmic density 1, their Collatz orbits come arbitrarily close to bounded values ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=,the%20sense%20of%20logarithmic%20density))  This is the rigorous publication of Tao’s breakthrough result (preprint posted in 2019) showing the conjecture holds “almost” for “almost all” numbers ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=On%20September%208%2C%20Terence%20Tao,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  *(DOI: 10.1017/fmp.2022.8, arXiv:1909.03562)* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=8.%20,8)) 

- **Emre Yolcu, Scott Aaronson, Marijn J. H. Heule (2023)** – *“An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture.”* **Journal of Automated Reasoning**, **67**(2): 217–243, 2023. This work recasts Collatz as a problem of proving termination of a rewriting system and uses automated theorem-proving techniques to tackle it ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=,feasibility%20of%20our%20approach%20in))  The authors’ program could automatically prove certain weaker propositions about Collatz, illustrating a new computational approach, although a full proof remained out of reach ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=prove%20that%20the%20termination%20of,we%20believe%20that%20the%20ideas))  *(arXiv:2105.14697)*.

- **Ilia Krasikov & Jeffrey C. Lagarias (2003)** – *“Bounds for the 3x+1 problem using difference inequalities.”* **Acta Arithmetica**, **109**(3): 237–258, 2003. This paper established rigorous lower bounds on how many numbers up to $x$ must satisfy the conjecture. Notably, it proved that the proportion of numbers $\le x$ that eventually reach 1 is at least on the order of $x^{0.84}$ ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=promising%20if%20one%20is%20willing,of%20Krasikov%20and%20Lagarias%20that))  ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=%5BImage%2016%3A%20%5Cdisplaystyle%20%5C,0.84))  providing evidence that “most” integers obey Collatz. It uses analytic and combinatorial arguments to derive inequalities constraining possible counterexamples.

- **Shalom Eliahou (1993)** – *“The 3x+1 problem: new lower bounds on nontrivial cycle lengths.”* **Discrete Mathematics**, **118**(1): 45–56, 1993.  This paper tackled the possibility of **cycles** other than the trivial 4–2–1. Eliahou proved that any hypothetical cycle (a repeating loop that is not 1–4–2) would have to be extremely long – in fact, any such cycle must contain **at least 75,128,138,247** numbers ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Paul%20Erd%C5%91s%20%20said%20about,However%2C%20though%20the%20Collatz%20conjecture))  ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=13.%20,U))  This dramatic lower bound (enormously larger than any feasible search) implies that if a cycle exists, it is far beyond current computational reach, thereby supporting the conjecture’s truth in all tested ranges.

- **J. Simons & B. de Weger (2005)** – *“Theoretical and computational bounds for $m$-cycles of the 3n+1 problem.”* **Acta Arithmetica**, **117**(1): 51–70, 2005. This later work built on Eliahou’s result, extending the search for cycles and improving bounds. Simons and de Weger used theoretical analysis combined with extensive computation to show that any cycle different from 1-2-4 must have a length greater than $2.6\times 10^{17011}$ (an astronomically large number) ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=bounds%20on%20nontrivial%20cycle%20lengths,28.%60%7B%7Bcite%20journal%7D%7D%60%3A%20CS1%20maint%3A%20bot))  Together with Eliahou’s result, this confirms that **no small cycle exists** other than the trivial one, and any potential cycle is unfathomably large, if it exists at all.

- **Jeffrey C. Lagarias (2010, editor)** – *“The Ultimate Challenge: The 3x+1 Problem.”* **American Mathematical Society**, 2010. This is a comprehensive **book** compiling surveys and research on the Collatz conjecture up to 2010 ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=8.%20,orbits%20of%20the%20Collatz%20map))  It includes an annotated bibliography of hundreds of papers and known results, making it a key reference for anyone studying the problem. In this volume, Lagarias famously remarked that the Collatz conjecture is *“an extraordinarily difficult problem, completely out of reach of present day mathematics”* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Paul%20Erd%C5%91s%20%20said%20about,9))  The book highlights various approaches and partial progress made over the years, while underscoring the problem’s stubborn resistance to solution.

## 3. Websites, Blogs, and Online Resources

A number of **reputable websites and online resources** provide information, discussion, and updates on the Collatz conjecture. Here are some useful links:

- **Wikipedia – "Collatz conjecture":** The Wikipedia entry offers a solid overview of the problem’s statement, history, and partial results ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=The%20Collatz%20conjecture,no%20general%20proof%20has%20been))  It includes references to key papers, quotes from experts like Erdős and Lagarias, and notes on verified ranges. This page is a good starting point for general information and further references.

- **Terry Tao’s Blog – *“Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values”*:** On his blog *What’s New*, Terence Tao wrote an expository post (September 2019) explaining his result in accessible terms ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=10%20September%2C%202019%20in%20math,by%20Terence%20Tao))  He discusses prior work by Krasikov, Lagarias, Terras, Allouche, and Korec leading up to his theorem ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=promising%20if%20one%20is%20willing,of%20Krasikov%20and%20Lagarias%20that))  ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BCol%7D_%7B%5Cmin%7D%28N%29%20,natural%20density%20to%20logarithmic%20density))  Tao’s blog post provides intuition behind the probabilistic and ergodic theory techniques used, and is valuable for readers interested in the **mathematical ideas** without all the technical details.

- **Quanta Magazine – *“Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem”* (2019):** A well-written **popular article** by Kevin Hartnett in *Quanta* Magazine reporting on Tao’s breakthrough ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=On%20September%208%2C%20Terence%20Tao,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  It describes the Collatz conjecture’s lure and danger, includes commentary from experts (with Lagarias likening it to a “siren song” ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=Experienced%20mathematicians%20warn%20up,never%20do%20meaningful%20work%20again)) , and explains the significance of Tao’s work in layman’s terms. Quanta Magazine is known for making advanced science accessible, and this article is no exception.

- **Chalkdust Magazine – *“Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture”* (2020):** An approachable **blog-style article** that introduces the Collatz problem, why it’s hard, and mentions recent progress (including Tao’s result in 2019) ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=cases%20checking%E2%80%94for%20example%2C%20we%20know,have%20some%20%E2%80%98almost%E2%80%99%20good%20jokes))  It humorously notes that Tao proved Collatz is “‘almost’ true for ‘almost all’ starting numbers” ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=Another%20approach%20would%20be%20to,have%20some%20%E2%80%98almost%E2%80%99%20good%20jokes))  The article also highlights the latest computational verification status (all numbers up to $2^{68}$ checked) ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20all%20initial,58))  This resource is great for a general audience and includes simple explanations and even a bit of light-hearted commentary.

- **Eric Roosendaal’s "3x+1 Delay Records" page:** An online resource tracking **record-breaking Collatz sequences**, i.e. numbers with notably large total stopping times (the number of steps to reach 1). This site (maintained by Collatz enthusiast Eric Roosendaal) lists the highest “delay” found for ranges of integers ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=11.%20%5E%20Roosendaal%2C%20Eric.%20,77%20%283%29%3A%202681%E2%80%932688))  Essentially, it documents which starting values take the longest to reach 1 below certain thresholds. While technical, it’s a treasure trove for those interested in the empirical behavior of hailstone sequences and is frequently updated as new records are discovered.

- **Online forums and Q&A:** Platforms like *Math StackExchange* and *MathOverflow* host discussions on the Collatz conjecture. For example, MathOverflow has a summary discussion breaking down Tao’s paper ([Summary of “Almost All Orbits of the Collatz Map ... - MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/394553/summary-of-almost-all-orbits-of-the-collatz-map-attain-almost-bounded-values#:~:text=Summary%20of%20%E2%80%9CAlmost%20All%20Orbits,it%27s%20also%20long%20and%20complicated))  and StackExchange users often ask about known results or computational checks ([Collatz stopping times - Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2377748/collatz-stopping-times#:~:text=Collatz%20stopping%20times%20,Plotting%20those))  These can be helpful to see **community explanations**, though one should be cautious and stick to highly upvoted or expert answers.

## 4. Key Researchers and Institutions

Given the Collatz conjecture’s notoriety, many mathematicians have dabbled in it, but only a few have made notable recent contributions or are actively working on it. Below are some of the **key researchers** and groups associated with Collatz progress, along with their affiliations:

- **Terence Tao (UCLA):** A Fields Medalist mathematician who achieved a major partial result on Collatz in 2019 ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=On%20September%208%2C%20Terence%20Tao,give%20up%20its%20secrets%20easily))  Tao’s work brought tools from analytic number theory and probability to bear on the problem, and his insight has reinvigorated interest in Collatz. (Institution: University of California, Los Angeles)

- **Emre Yolcu, Scott Aaronson, Marijn Heule (CMU & UT Austin):** This trio of computer scientists has pioneered the automated approach to Collatz ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=prove%20that%20the%20termination%20of,we%20believe%20that%20the%20ideas))  *Yolcu* (Carnegie Mellon University) and his advisor *Marijn J. H. Heule* (CMU) specialize in logic and SAT-solving techniques, while *Scott Aaronson* (University of Texas at Austin) is known for work in theoretical computer science. Together, they applied computational logic methods to Collatz, representing a collaboration between institutions (CMU and UT Austin) and bridging mathematics with computer science.

- **Jeffrey C. Lagarias (University of Michigan):** A number theorist who has been an authority on the 3x+1 problem for decades ([Mathematician Proves Huge Result on ‘Dangerous’ Problem | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-proves-huge-result-on-dangerous-problem-20191211/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThis%20is%20a%20really%20dangerous,expert%20on%20the%20Collatz%20conjecture))  Lagarias compiled the definitive 2010 book on the subject ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=8.%20,orbits%20of%20the%20Collatz%20map)) and has co-authored important results (e.g. the 2003 bounds with Krasikov ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Result%20on%20%27Dangerous%27%20Problem,arXiv%3Amath%2F0205002)) . Although retired from active teaching, he remains an influential figure in Collatz research. The University of Michigan has thus been a notable center for Collatz expertise through his work.

- **Ilia Krasikov (Brunel University London):** A mathematician who, along with Lagarias, contributed one of the strongest known partial results by establishing density bounds for Collatz-obeying numbers ([Almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values | What's new](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/#:~:text=promising%20if%20one%20is%20willing,of%20Krasikov%20and%20Lagarias%20that))  ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Result%20on%20%27Dangerous%27%20Problem,arXiv%3Amath%2F0205002))  Krasikov’s involvement highlights international collaboration (Brunel in the UK working with Michigan in the US) on the problem’s analytic aspects. His work in the early 2000s is still frequently cited in current research.

- **Shalom Eliahou (CNRS, Univ. of Lille, France):** A researcher who has studied the Collatz problem’s structural properties, especially regarding cycles ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=%281%29%3A%2019%E2%80%9322.%20doi%3A10.1090%2FS0002,U))  Eliahou proved extremely large lower bounds on cycle lengths (if any exist besides the trivial cycle). He continues to be associated with Collatz-related research in France, often exploring the problem from a discrete dynamical systems perspective.

- **Other Contributors:** *John Horton Conway* (Princeton, deceased 2020) is noted for his 1970s result on undecidable generalizations of Collatz ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Undecidable%20generalizations))  illustrating the problem’s deep complexity. **Paul Erdős** and **Stanislav Kirillov** provided early heuristic insights into Collatz dynamics (Erdős famously said, *“Mathematics may not be ready for such problems”* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Paul%20Erd%C5%91s%20%20said%20about,However%2C%20though%20the%20Collatz%20conjecture)) . On the computational side, people like **Tomas Oliveira e Silva** (University of Algarve) and **David Barina** have led large-scale verification projects ([Easy to state, hard to prove: The Collatz conjecture - Chalkdust](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/easy-to-state-hard-to-prove-the-collatz-conjecture/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20all%20initial,58))  often in affiliation with high-performance computing centers or universities. These efforts, though not proving the conjecture, are crucial for pushing the frontier of exhaustive search.

In terms of **institutional involvement**, no single institute “owns” the Collatz conjecture, but places like **UCLA**, **Carnegie Mellon University**, **UT Austin**, **University of Michigan**, and various European universities (Brunel, Lille, etc.) have been home to significant research on the problem. The **American Mathematical Society (AMS)** has supported dissemination (through Lagarias’s book ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=8.%20,orbits%20of%20the%20Collatz%20map)) , and the **Simons Foundation** has indirectly supported work like Tao’s via research funding ([[2105.14697] An Automated Approach to the Collatz Conjecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14697#:~:text=We%20gratefully%20acknowledge%20support%20from,Donate))  Overall, the Collatz conjecture draws a **diverse community** of mathematicians and computer scientists, reflecting its blend of simple charm and formidable challenge.

## **Conclusion**

The Collatz conjecture remains unsolved, but the past few years have seen **meaningful progress** in understanding its behavior. Through a combination of analytic number theory, probabilistic methods, computational brute force, and automated reasoning, researchers are chipping away at the problem’s mysteries. The conjecture’s lure endures: it sits at the intersection of deep mathematics and playful exploration. As resources above show, even if a complete proof continues to elude us, the journey has produced new techniques and insights with applications beyond Collatz itself ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=Paul%20Erd%C5%91s%20%20said%20about,9))  Researchers around the world – from classical mathematicians to computer-assisted explorers – continue to collaboratively push on this “ultimate challenge,” hopeful that one day all *hailstone sequences* will indeed be proven to *“lead to 1.”* ([Collatz conjecture - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#:~:text=,paths%20eventually%20lead%20to%201))
