# Architecture
The 3n+1, collatz or hailstone numbers problem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture
## Optimizations
  The focus here is on the base algorithm which is independent of the programming language used.  However, there are 'architecture aware' optimizations that we will detail as we get closer to the hardware using AVX, CUDA or Metal.
### Optimization 1: Combine odd/even steps
The following optimization will speed up a run by up to 21%

When we have an odd number, the next step is usually 3n + 1 applied to the current value.  However, the number resulting from 3n + 1 will always be positive - which will require at least one divide by 2.

The operation...
```
3n + 1 = n << 1 + n + 1
with a subsequent
n / 2 = n >> 1
```

can be expressed as a single
```
n / 2 + n + 1 = n > 1 + n + 1
```
### Optimization 2: Roll up all divide by 2 sequences
When whe have for example a power of 2 like 256 - this will represent a straight path to 1 via 8 shift right operations.

# Performance Numbers

## Criteria
- CON: Single / Multi threaded (both CPU and GPU (you can use just 1 ALU core in a GPU)
- PRU: CPU / GPU
- FRM: native / framework (as in java long (64 bit max) or java BigInteger (open ended))
- BIT: 64 / 128 / 256 bit
- LAN: language (C, Swift, Go, Java, Python, Rust)
- ARC: Architecture (IA64/AMD64 or ARM64 - or agnostic (JIT compiled Go))
